## üá∫üá∏ US Investor Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & KYC
1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Connect wallet via Dynamic.xyz (supports social login)
   - System auto-detects US jurisdiction
   - Redirected to US-specific vault pages

2. **Mandatory KYC Verification**
   - Automatic redirect to `access.redbelly.network` if not KYC'd
   - Complete Redbelly Network KYC verification
   - Jurisdiction validation prevents circumvention
   - **Cannot proceed without KYC completion**

### Phase 2: Accreditation Verification ‚≠ê NEW
3. **Accreditation Status Check**
   - System creates 30-day accreditation deadline for new US investors
   - Three possible paths:

#### Path A: Standard 30-Day Process
- Redirect to `investready.com` for accreditation verification
- 30-day grace period for document submission
- Can make provisional investments during grace period
- **Automatic cancellation** if deadline expires without accreditation

#### Path B: Manual Admin Override ‚≠ê NEW (V1)
- Investor contacts admin with existing documentation
- Admin calls: `POST /api/admin/users/:userId/approve-accreditation`
- Provides documentation details:
  ```json
  {
    "adminId": 1,
    "documentationType": "Form D Filing / CPA Letter / etc",
    "documentationNotes": "Details about existing proof",
    "bypassReason": "Investor has SEC Form D from previous investment"
  }
  ```
- **Instant approval** - bypasses 30-day deadline completely
- Creates audit trail with admin ID, timestamp, documentation type
- Investor receives approval notification

#### Path C: Document Upload Portal (V2 Planned)
- Investor uploads accreditation proof directly
- Admin review queue (2-3 business days)
- Much faster than 30-day standard process

### Phase 3: Investment Process
4. **Currency Options**
   - Input: USDC/AVAX (familiar currencies)
   - Automatic conversion to USDT/RBNT on Redbelly Network
   - Platform handles cross-chain bridging seamlessly

5. **Yield Tier Selection**
   - 30-day lockup: 8% APR
   - 90-day lockup: 10% APR  
   - 365-day lockup: 12% APR
   - Minimum investment: $5,000 (regulatory compliance)

6. **Investment Validation**
   - System blocks investments from non-accredited users past deadline
   - Clear error messages if compliance not met
   - Provisional status during grace period

### Phase 4: Notification System ‚≠ê NEW
7. **Smart Deadline Tracking**
   - Initial accreditation reminder popup
   - 3-day interval reminders during grace period
   - Urgent warnings at 7 days remaining
   - Critical alerts at 3 days remaining
   - Dismissible banners with countdown timers

### Phase 5: Automatic Compliance ‚≠ê NEW
8. **Background Processing**
   - Scheduler runs every 6 hours checking deadlines
   - Automatic investment cancellation for expired deadlines
   - Principal-only refunds (no interest) for cancelled investments
   - Investment status changes from "provisional" to "cancelled"
